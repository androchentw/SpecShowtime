  title: "Coding Challenge System"
  priority: major
  businessValue: >
    Provide users with a platform to solve programming and data science challenges tailored to their skills, helping them improve technical expertise.
  description: >
    Build a system where users can browse, attempt, and solve coding challenges that align with their skillsets and interests. Challenges will include algorithmic problems, data science tasks, and real-world scenarios.
  objectives:
    - "Allow users to solve coding challenges in various domains like algorithms and data science."
    - "Provide difficulty levels to cater to beginners and advanced users."
    - "Enable users to run code directly in the browser using cloud-based execution."
  acceptanceCriteria:
    - "Users can browse challenges by category and difficulty level."
    - "Users can write and execute code in the browser without local setup."
    - "The system validates solutions and provides feedback on correctness."
